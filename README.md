An Expermental config based UI for my house.

The idea is my activities are not contained to room. Turning off one light is often followed by turning on a light in another room.

The idea of this app is to prepare the moods for all the rooms in the house based on the task to be performed.

Currently only hooks up to Lightwave RF.


#Installation

Difficult, if you have a Ninjablock and a Lightwave RF  Wifi link unit you could try emailing me.
